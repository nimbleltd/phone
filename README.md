Purpose

written in Ruby, a command line tool that will display staff/team/class contact info in the command line for groups.
It is assumed this tool would be useful to teams of 20 or more.

data stored in Active Record

Planned usage is as follows:
----------------------------
> "phone \<firstname\>" 

and the contact info will print to the screen

User Story
----------
As a staff member I need to contact someone from another department whose firstname I know.
I want to contact that person quickly and easily.
If I can type "phone \<firstname\>/\<lastname\> or \<mis-spelled-name\>" from my terminal and have contact info displayed.
That would save me time.

Demo
----
To demo the app, you'll have to download it and try it yourself.
